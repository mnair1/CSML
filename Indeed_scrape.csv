I communicated with a representative from Google on a daily basis to report my progress. - The most difficult part of the job was driving long distances after a strenuous day of hiking with heavy equipment on my back. - The scenery and some of the individuals from Parks Canada were definitely the most enjoyable parts of the job.",Extensive travel,Long or unreliable hours
